Next I created a Repository from Webstorm to complete that I clicked VSC, crate repository then give it a name and click OK.

After creating repository I created a new project and connected to the repository, to complete that I clicked File,New,Project and gave it a name. Then I created first file. 

To create new file I clicked new, file and named it README.md and then ok. Once the file was created I wrote all information in it. 

After I clicked Git, Commit, and highlighted the file then wrote a commit message and clicked commit push.

The file was sent to my GitHub repository : https://github.com/kamilweglarz/A03
